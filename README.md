This is a first attempt at a simple Collada rig class written in Swift for SceneKit. It stores and triggers various animations exported from Blender as Collada .dae files. It's derived partly from Apple examples such as the [Fox demo](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/Fox/Introduction/Intro.html), and a number of other sources, but particularly [this Stack Overflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28315135/adding-and-transitioning-animations-in-scenekit). The class assumes that the animation contained in the master `.dae` file (the one with the geometry) is the "rest" animation. The "walk" animation starts by pausing the "rest" animation and ends with "rest" resuming. Press and hold the mouse button to make the figure walk, release to resume the resting pose.
